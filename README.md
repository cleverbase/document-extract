# Document Extract

During the [May 2024 pressure cooker on qualifications](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/cleverbase_qeaa-qes-digitalidentity-activity-7202340639286411264-JKwl), Vidua has explored how to apply attestations in trust services. For this use case, it is necessary to represent attestations in a way that parties beyond the issuer, user, and reader can rely upon. This representation we call a **Document Extract**.

This repository contains current ideas on how to create and use a Document Extract. Feedback is welcome.

Get started with [Document Extract with mdoc](mdoc.md).
